# Wazuh SIEM Lab

This project is a virtual Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab built using **Wazuh**, aimed at simulating and analyzing real-world cyberattacks.

## Lab Stack
- **Wazuh** – Open-source SIEM platform
- **Kibana** – Log visualization and alerting
- **VirtualBox** – Virtualization environment
- **MITRE ATT&CK** – Threat mapping framework
- **Linux** – OS for log generation and attack simulation

## Simulated Activities
- Brute-force login attempts
- Privilege escalation
- File tampering and unauthorized changes

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Generate events** using simulated attacks in a virtual Linux environment.
2. **Detect and review alerts** in Wazuh and Kibana dashboards.
3. **Map alerts** to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for threat context.
4. **Review rule sets**, alert levels, and investigate response options.

## Purpose
This lab demonstrates practical cybersecurity skills in:
- Incident detection and response
- Log analysis and correlation
- Threat simulation and mapping
- Hands-on familiarity with SIEM tooling

## Status
This is a completed, self-contained lab built as part of a portfolio for cybersecurity analyst roles. Future versions may include automation scripts or extended use cases.
